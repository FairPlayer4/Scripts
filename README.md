# Scripts
A collection of scripts that I have written, basically proof that Powershell is easy :)  
I use a C# coding style so the scripts will not look like conventional scripts.  
I also use .NET libraries in those scripts.
If someone is interested in how these scripts work or you need a modifications to fit your needs then send me a message.
  
GenerateThriftCode  
-> Generates thrift code for java and c# in different packages/namespaces (for detailed description pm me). It was used to simplify the process of creating thrift code in the process of development.

UpdateEclipseClasspath  
-> Generates the eclipse classpath for a maven project (dependencies need to be copied to a folder libs in the project). It was used to allow creating a non-maven eclipse build for developers that did not have maven installed.
